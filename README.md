# MobileLaunchVehicle
The code for a robotic mobile rocket launcher. Hardware requirement is a robot with Rev Expansion Hub and Android phone for robot controller. For safety, robot should be built with redundant (fail-off) switches/relays, a kill-switch that prevents launch when rockets are not near vertical, and physical locks that insure the launch platform cannot physically fail (come loose / fall off) during launch.
