# MobileLaunchVehicle
The code for a robotic mobile rocket launcher. Hardware requirement is a robot with Rev Expansion Hub and Android phone for robot controller. For safety, robot should be built with redundant (fail-off) switches/relays, a kill-switch that prevents launch when rockets are not within 30 degrees of vertical, and physical locks must be used to insure the launch platform cannot physically fail (come loose / fall off) during launch. 

All safety and best practices for rocket launches must also be followed. See: https://www.nar.org/safety-information/model-rocket-safety-code/.
